# Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Project 2: Continuous Control in Reacher environment

##### Overview:

The aim of this project is to train an agent, which is adouble-jointed arm, to learn how to reach his moving target. The report describes my implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. My solution implements a DDPG agent based on the Continuous Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf).
